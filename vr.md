**What is VR?**

Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that immerses users in a completely virtual world using a headset. It’s mainly used for gaming, education, and simulations. When you put on a VR headset, you’re transported to a different environment, and it feels real.

Augmented Reality (AR) adds virtual objects in the real world. Unlike VR, which creates a whole new world, AR adds digital things to what you’re already seeing.
